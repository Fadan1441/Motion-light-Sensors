controling and led light using a motion sensor and a photoresistor
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4ea50d9-5334-4973-93de-be2b53f37fa3)

This version works without the website 

https://wokwi.com/projects/404452190035155969

you control the sensors manually 
if there is a motion and no light the led will turn on
otherwise it's off

This version is suppose to work with a website that control the light sensor

https://wokwi.com/projects/404448753594833921\

but its a work in progress as the website always return the value 0
and controling the light sensor using the value from the website is yet to be figured out
