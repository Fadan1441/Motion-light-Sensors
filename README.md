This version works without the website 

https://wokwi.com/projects/404452190035155969

you control the sensors manually 
if there is a motion and no light the led will turn on
otherwise it's off

This version is suppose to work with a website that control the light sensor

https://wokwi.com/projects/404448753594833921\

but its a work in progress as the website always return the value 0
and controlling the light sensor using the value from the website is yet to be figured out
